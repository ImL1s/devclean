# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A Bash script that safely kills orphaned development processes (PPID=1) to reclaim memory. Supports macOS and Linux. Two modes: safe mode (orphans only) and `--deep` mode (heavy daemons like Gradle, Kotlin LSP, iOS Simulators).

## Development Commands

```bash
./devclean          # Run safe orphan cleanup
./devclean --deep   # Aggressive cleanup (Gradle, Flutter daemon, simulators, etc.)
./install.sh             # Install to ~/.local/bin/devclean
bash -n devclean    # Syntax check
shellcheck devclean # Static lint (recommended)
```

## Architecture

Single-file script (`devclean`) with this flow:

1. **Argument parsing** — Supports `--deep`, `--dry-run`, `--help`; flags are combinable in any order
2. **OS detection** — `uname -s` to distinguish Darwin/Linux
3. **Pattern matching** — `ORPHAN_PATTERNS` array defines regex patterns for targetable processes (MCP servers, AI language servers, Node wrappers, frontend dev servers, Dart/Flutter tooling, iOS logging)
4. **Safe cleanup** — Finds processes matching patterns with `PPID=1`, plus orphaned `adb logcat`; kills via `kill_and_report()`
5. **Deep cleanup** (`--deep`) — `cleanup_by_name()` targets non-orphaned heavy daemons (Kotlin LSP, Gradle, Flutter daemon); `cleanup_orphaned_by_name()` for xcodebuild (PPID=1 only); macOS-specific `xcrun simctl shutdown all` for iOS Simulators

Key functions:
- `report_stats(PIDS, LABEL)` — Calculates memory usage via `ps -o rss=` and prints report
- `graceful_kill(PIDS)` — SIGTERM → wait 2s → SIGKILL fallback for stubborn processes; respects `--dry-run`
- `kill_and_report(PIDS, LABEL)` — Combines `report_stats` + `graceful_kill`
- `cleanup_by_name(LABEL, PATTERN)` — Uses `pgrep -f` to find and kill matching processes
- `cleanup_orphaned_by_name(LABEL, PATTERN)` — Same but restricted to PPID=1 (safe for tools like xcodebuild that may be actively in use)

## Coding Conventions

- Bash with `#!/bin/bash`; uppercase for globals (`ORPHAN_PATTERNS`, `REGEX_PATTERN`), `snake_case` for functions
- `ORPHAN_PATTERNS` array is the primary extension point — add new patterns there when supporting new tools
- Comments in Chinese (繁體中文) are normal for this project
- Commit style: `feat:`, `refactor:`, `style:` prefixed, imperative, single logical change
